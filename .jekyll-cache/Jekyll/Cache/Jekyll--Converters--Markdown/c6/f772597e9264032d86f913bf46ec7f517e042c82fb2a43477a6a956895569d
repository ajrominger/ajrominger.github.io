<p><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html">This article</a> about the “intelectual dark web” by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari_Weiss">this author</a> who has a history of feeling oppressed by such people as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Massad#Columbia_Unbecoming">Prof. Joseph Massad</a>.</p>

<p>In general: do members of the IDW promote or retard freedom of speech? Does a privledged group of individuals feeling less privledged amount to an assult of freedom of speech? If their speech conflicts with that of another group—one that has been historically and presently stripped of voice by our society—it seems like the right thing to do is listen to the new voice, rather than have a knee-jerk reaction about one’s own broken record of a voice.</p>

<p>Then this specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In recent days, for example, Mr. Harris has been labeled by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a bridge to the alt-right: “Under the guise of scientific objectivity, Harris has presented deeply flawed data to perpetuate fear of Muslims and to argue that black people are genetically inferior to whites.”</p>

  <p>That isn’t true. The group excoriated Mr. Harris, a fierce critic of the treatment of women and gays under radical Islam, for saying that “some percentage, however small” of Muslim immigrants are radicalized. He has also estimated that some 20 percent of Muslims worldwide are Islamists or jihadis. But he has never said that this should make people fear all Muslims. He has defended the work of the social scientist Charles Murray, who argues that genetic differences may explain differences in average IQ across racial groups — while insisting that this does not make one group inferior to another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is <em>very</em> true. Conjuring a mysterios number like 20% strikes me as pseudo science (i.e. “the guise of scientific objectivity”). And if 20% of a group holds violent views, it is far to be alarmed, thus claiming (without validation) that 20% of Muslims hold violent views can only “perpetuate fear.”</p>

<p>Then there’s the “work” of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Murray_(political_scientist)">Charles Murray</a>. I would call his writing “claims” at best—there is <em>no</em> scientific work he presents to back-up his “ideas.” Differences in ID are likely best attributed to differences in stress levels and nutrition amoung different levels of wealth and impoverishment.</p>
