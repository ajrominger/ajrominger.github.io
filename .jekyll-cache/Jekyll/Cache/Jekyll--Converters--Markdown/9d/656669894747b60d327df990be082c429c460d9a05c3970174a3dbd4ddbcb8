I"–<p>How and why does evolutionary history drive contemporary ecological dynamics? I approach this question both from a theoretical perspective, building and testing synthetic theories of biodiversity based on statistical mechanics, and from an empirical perspective, collecting new data about the evolution and ecology of arthropod groups, using it to test how their past rates of diversification drive their current distribution of diversity across geographic space.  Below is a sampling of active areas of research</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ajrominger/hawaiiMETE/blob/master/README.md">Evolution and the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology</a>. How does evolution drive communities away from statistical steady state? To answer this I explore macroecological patterns across the chronosequence of the Hawaiian Islands using the theoretical lens provided by the principle of maximum information entropy.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cmerow/meteR/blob/master/README.md">Scientific computing</a> for <a href="https://github.com/ajrominger/pika">macroecology</a>. I build open source statistical software for macroecology.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/hawaiiDimensions/mol2ecol/blob/master/README.md">Next generation ecology</a>: The advent of high throughput sequencing for community-wide ecological samples presents a huge opportunity. Iâ€™m using hierarchical models to reconstruct abundance, body size and phylogenetic patterns, as well as eco-evolutionary processes from next generation sequencing surveys. We are also very excited for a new Rules of Life <a href="https://role-model.github.io/">grant</a> to support this work.</p>
