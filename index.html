    <p>I am interested in the processes that lead to persistent patterns in life, from the biological to the social. Why do the distributions of individual organisms acorss species, or populations across geographic space follow consisten mathematical forms? Why is economic inequality pervasive? Why are preconceptions hard to change? I hope that by understanding where these near universalities come from we can make our world more sustainable for all kinds of diversities. I am trained as a computational ecologist and evolutionary biologist, but I'm working on branching out into other disciplines.  You can follow my research in progress <a href="https://ajrominger.github.io/research/" target="_blank">here</a>, while gleam-in-the-eye ideas are here, and polished products are <a href="https://ajrominger.github.io/publications/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
