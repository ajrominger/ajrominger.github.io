## R packages

To promote open and reproducible science Iâ€™ve built two R packages (with more on the way!) aimed at macroecology.  One implements the maximum entropy theory of ecology (meteR, available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meteR/index.html)) and the other provides object-oriented methods for species abundance distributions, species area relationships and other macroecological patterns (pika, available on [github](https://github.com/ajrominger/pika)).
