How and why does evolutionary history drive contemporary ecological dynamics? I approach this question both from a theoretical perspective, building and testing synthetic theories of biodiversity based on statistical mechanics, and from an empirical perspective, collecting new data about the evolution and ecology of arthropod groups, using it to test how their past rates of diversification drive their current distribution of diversity across geographic space.  Below is a sampling of active areas of research

[Superstatistics of Phanerozoic biodiversity](https://ajrominger.github.io/research/sstat).  Modeling deep time evolution as a non-equilibrium statistical system.

[Evolution and the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology](https://ajrominger.github.io/research/evolMaxEnt). How does evolution drive communities away from statistical steady state? To answer this I explore macroecological patterns across the chronosequence of the Hawaiian Islands using the theoretical lens provided by the principle of maximum information entropy.

[Scientific computing for macroecology](https://ajrominger.github.io/research/rPack). I build open source statistical software for macroecology.

[Next generation ecology](https://ajrominger.github.io/research/ngEco): massive genetic data for all. Iâ€™m using hierarchical models to reconstruct abundance, body size and phylogenetic data from next generation sequencing of huge arthropod surveys.
