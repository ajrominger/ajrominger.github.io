## Next generation ecology 

High throughput sequencing is revolutionizing ecology and evolution.  Currently molecular studies are limited by time and cost of preparing DNA extractions and libraries for individual specimens or, if specimens are pooled before extraction and library preparation, by their ability to distinguish individuals and assign valid abundances to taxa.  Along with collaborators at UC Berkeley I am developing methods based on hierarchical modeling to used pooled samples to estimate abundance, body size and phylogenetic relatedness of taxa.  These methods could be used to bulk sequence and analyse thousands of individuals simultaneously, dramatically accelerating (and making more affordable) the rate of data acquisition for biodiversity studies.
